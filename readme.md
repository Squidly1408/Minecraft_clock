# Minecraft Clock

This is a lightweight Windows desktop app that visually represents the Minecraft day-night cycle using real-time. It displays a transparent, frameless image that updates throughout the day based on the current time, using a set of 63 image frames designed to look like Minecraftâ€™s sky cycle. It sits on top of other windows, remains visible even when unfocused, and uses a custom Windows taskbar icon.

The project was created as a fun experiment to merge real-world timekeeping with the familiar Minecraft aesthetic. Itâ€™s ideal for those who want a dynamic, minimal clock that feels like it came straight from a pixel world.
